### **SLIDE 1: Title**
**DANAYA: National Health Platform for Burkina Faso**
A Personal Initiative Applying Japanese Technology & Collaborative Spirit

**Presented by:** Kader BONZI
**Sensei:** [Sensei Name]
**Context:** Cybersecurity Master's Student
**Date:** December 2025

**Project Philosophy:**
*"Combining Japanese technological excellence with Burkinabè social needs"*

### **SLIDE 2: Why This Project? (Personal Motivation)**

**My Background:**
- Born and raised in Burkina Faso 🇧🇫
- Currently studying Cybersecurity in Japan 🇯🇵
- Witnessed healthcare challenges firsthand
- Want to give back to my country

**The Problem I Saw:**
- My grandmother traveled 150km to see a specialist
- Her medical records were on paper, lost during transfer
- Rural health centers cannot consult CHU doctors
- Preventable deaths due to lack of coordination

**Personal Mission:**
*"Use what I'm learning in Japan to solve real problems in Burkina Faso"*

**Not a Thesis - A Calling:**
- This is personal, not academic requirement
- Will continue beyond graduation
- Seeking guidance, not grades

---

### **SLIDE 3: The Burkina Faso Healthcare Reality**

**Current Situation:**
- 180+ healthcare facilities across 13 regions
- 4-tier system: CHU → CHR → CMA → CSPS
- Paper-based records (90%+ facilities)
- No digital communication between facilities
- Rural areas: 1 doctor per 10,000+ people

**Real Stories:**
1. **Awa's Story (CSPS Dori):**
   - Pregnant woman, complications
   - CSPS nurse cannot reach CHU doctor
   - 6-hour ambulance ride to Ouagadougou
   - No medical history transferred
   - Baby born during transport

2. **Dr. Ouedraogo's Frustration (CHU Ouaga):**
   - Receives transferred patients with no information
   - Has to repeat all tests (costly, time-consuming)
   - Sometimes patients die before diagnosis

**The Gap:**
*Technology exists globally, but not adapted for Burkina Faso's reality*

### **SLIDE 8: Japanese Influence in Design**

**How Japanese Principles Shaped DANAYA:**

**1. Simplicity (シンプル)**
```
Bad (Complex):            Good (DANAYA):
Multiple login steps  →   Single login page
Confusing navigation  →   Clear 5-page menu
English only         →   100% French
```

- Automatic restart if failure
- Redundancy built-in

**3. Attention to Detail (細部へのこだわり)**
- Hospital logos color-coded by type
- French translations culturally adapted
- Regional names spelled correctly
- Error messages helpful, not cryptic

**4. User First (ユーザーファースト)**
- Designed with actual doctors/nurses in mind
- Offline mode for rural areas
- Fast loading on slow internet
- Large buttons for touchscreens

**5. Long-term Thinking (長期的思考)**
- Not just building software
- Building sustainable system
- Training included
